An algorithm for computing the k-numerical range

# The $k$-Numerical Range

This project implements a Python-based algorithm to approximate the **$k$-numerical range** of a complex matrix.

## üîç What is the $k$-Numerical Range?

The $k$-numerical range, $W_k(A)$, is a generalization of the classical numerical range. Instead of computing a single value $x^*Ax$ for a unit vector $x$, this version averages over $k$ orthonormal vectors:
$$W_k(A) = \left\{ \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j=1}^{k} x_j^* A x_j \ : \ x_j \text{ orthonormal} \right\}$$

This set is always:
- Convex (no sharp corners),
- Compact (bounded and closed),
- Useful in matrix theory and applications involving averages of eigenvalues.

## üß† How the Algorithm Works

To trace the boundary of $W_k(A)$, the algorithm:
1. **Rotates** the matrix by an angle $\theta$,
2. **Takes the real part** of the rotated matrix,
3. **Finds the top $k$ eigenvectors** with the largest eigenvalues,
4. **Averages** the values $x_j^* A x_j$ for those $k$ vectors,
5. **Repeats** for many angles to trace the boundary.

This approach generalizes a known method (Carl Cowen‚Äôs) for the classical case $k = 1$.

- `Senior_Project_Poster.pdf`: Visual summary of the algorithm and examples, suitable for presentations.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

This project uses:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

Install them with:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## üñºÔ∏è Sample Output

The script includes several plotted examples of the $k$-numerical range for different matrices, demonstrating how the shape evolves as $k$ changes.
